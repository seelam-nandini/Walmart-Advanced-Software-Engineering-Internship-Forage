# Walmart Virtual Internship - Forage

This repository contains the solutions to the tasks I completed as part of the Walmart Virtual Internship on Forage. The tasks involved solving real-world problems related to software development, data structures, and database design. Below is a brief description of each task and the code files associated with them.

## Task 1: Advanced Data Structures
In this task, I implemented a Power of Two Max Heap in Java. The heap satisfies the max-heap property where each parent node has 2^x children, with x being a parameter provided during the heap's construction. The code implements the insert and pop max operations efficiently.
## Task 2: Software Architecture 
This task involved designing a class diagram and implementing a software architecture that meets the specified requirements. The solution is documented with a class diagram and corresponding PDF.
## Task 3: Relational Database Design 
For this task, I designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and implemented a relational database design based on given requirements. The task includes the ERD and detailed documentation.
## Task 4: Data Munging with Python  
This task involved performing data munging using Python. The solution processes and cleans the data according to the requirements provided in the task description.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation provided for each task.
